BlogckTrans
===========

It's a simple tool to translate large articles paragraph-by-paragraph.

No registration, no collaboration, no permanent connection needed. Really, you can save this
page to your old laptop and translate texts even onÂ Everest!

Lately added Readability-style source URL parsing with [Goose](https://github.com/grangier/python-goose),
it needs a network connection.

Just click "Source" and paste source text with paragraphs splitted by double linebreaks.
Translate text pieces one-by-one and click "Result" to get translation in Markdown or HTML.
